This is a tutorial for implementing the breadth first search and A* algorithms.

We implement the basic BFS and test with a small graph in metro_map.ipynb. The implementation can be changed to a DFS by changing the queue to a stack. This can be done easily by changing pop(0) to just pop()

Then we use the same code in a gridwolrd to find the shortest path. Code a heuristics and implement A* using a very simple priority queue.

Finally we use the algorithms to solve 8-puzzle. The 15puzzle may be just beyond these shortest path algorithms. However we can use greedy algorithm to get a reasonable path.
